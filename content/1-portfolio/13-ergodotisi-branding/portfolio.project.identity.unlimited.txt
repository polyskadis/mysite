Summary: 

ergodotisi.com is Cyprus’ top job site and employment consultancy. In addition to advertising job listings and vacancies, ergodotisi self-curate a blog and social media presence providing support and advice to jobseekers and employers alike. Believing that companies—like individuals—are motivated by ideals, ergodotisi’s goal is to connect jobseekers and companies who are best suited for each other and whom share a mutual vision of the world.

Design Temple revamped ergodotisi's visual identity with a colourful, friendly and down to earth approach that contrasts sharply with the typically tedious and stuffy identities of other brands in the same market. The ergodotisi spiral logo is inspired by the ancient Greek spiral, a motive used throughout the ages to symbolise growth, expansion and evolution. We also designed a comprehensive set of more than 60 bespoke icons for use throughout ergodotisi’s website as well as on brand collateral in the form of a repeatable pattern.
