Title: Efstathios C. Efstathiou Law Firm

Summary: 

Efstathios C. Efstathiou is one of Cyprus’ most distinguished legal firms, established in 1961 and having built an enviable reputation over three generations of practice. The firm also offers document verification services and is a founding member of the SDDK, a non-political organisation promoting equality and human rights. The firm recently re-incorporated as an LLC and the opportunity emerged to establish a new visual identity to reposition Efstathiou as a historical establishment with a forward-facing vision.

To breathe new life into one of Cyprus’ oldest law firms, we built a new, responsive website to firmly re-establish the brand’s web presence. In contrast to many sites of its ilk, Efstathios C. Efstathiou’s website design focusses on purity of content and presentation. Superfluous elements are absent in favour of precise typography and luxurious white space in order to communicate the firm’s values of precision and quality.
