Summary: Efstathios C. Efstathiou is one of Cyprusâ€™ most distinguished legal firms, established in 1961 and having built an enviable reputation over three generations of practice. The firm also offers document verification services and is a founding member of the SDDK, a non-political organisation promoting equality and human rights. The firm recently re-incorporated as an LLC and the opportunity emerged to establish a new visual identity to reposition Efstathiou as a historical establishment with a forward-facing vision.

The identity resolves the often contrasting concepts of tradition and modernity through a robust, Blackletter-inspired monogram and wordmark. The calligraphic yet constructed nature of the identity communicates a sense of timeless precision and quality. Being a firm founded and run by the Efstathiou family, the logotype is a nod to the traditional family monogram.
