Summary: 

Batida De Loco is a team of professional mixologists and bartenders offering bar catering services and consultation for any kind of event. Batida De Loco’s award-winning cocktail recipes are made from the highest quality ingredients and their own hand-crafted syrups and purées.

Design Temple designed a visual identity for Batida De Loco emphasising the boutique, hand-crafted nature of their cocktails through a hand-drawn script logo and ten illustrations. At the same time, the identity expresses ten fundamental cocktail flavours through the use of colour, patterns and playful illustrations. We also wrote a unique brand story in the form of a short narrative entitled *Lou*, centred around a quirky protagonist who personifies the Batida De Loco brand.
