Summary: 

E.O. Concept & Design is a conceptual design firm focussing on architecture and interior design as well as jewellery design based between Nicosia, Cyprus and Istanbul, Turkey. Through their work, the firm explores the often sentimental notion of an interior space and its associations with time. Bespoke furniture design and a carefully curated collection of hand-selected antiques are united with artistry, craftsmanship and engineering to create spaces which speak to our presence within them. E.O. Fine Jewellery provide one-of-a-kind pieces of meticulously hand-crafted fine jewellery, drawing inspiration from Byzantine artistic tradition in addition to contemporary jewellery design.

Design Temple crafted a unique minimalistic web presence for E.O. Concept & Design with a design statement reflecting the ethos of the brand. Extraneous elements are absent to emphasise clarity and subtlety, giving way to stunning photography of the firmâ€™s work, offset by neutral typography and generous amounts of (black) white space.
