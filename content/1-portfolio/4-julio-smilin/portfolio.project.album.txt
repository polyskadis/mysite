Summary: Julio is one of Cyprus’ most prolific underground Hip Hop artists and MCs, having self-released dozens of tracks over the span of several years. At the same time, Smilin has built a reputation as one of the top independent producers of Hip Hop music on the island through his collaborations with various artists in the scene. Julio and Smilin conspired to record and release a full-length album entitled _Το Λάθος_ (“The Mistake”).

Written entirely in the Cypriot dialect and from the point of view of a distant observer, Julios’ ingenious and often complex verses act as lyrical assaults on the dysfunctional society of today. _Το Λάθος_ is a harrowing commentary on corruption, social decline and the disingenuous. The raw and bleak album cover features a hooded figure observing a blissfully oblivious populace as they go about their daily lives.
