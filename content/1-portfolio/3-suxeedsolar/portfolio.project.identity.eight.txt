Summary: Suxeed Solar is a renewable energy company aiming to provide households and businesses in Cyprus with solar energy systems that produce enough electricity to reduce or even eliminate their dependence on conventional energy. Suxeed Solar recently expanded their business to include a range of solar-powered consumer products.

We translated Suxeed Solarâ€™s mission to provide cutting-edge solar energy solutions and consumer products into a visual identity that marked a new era for the brand. The geometric identity reflects the construction and grid-like visual rhythm of photovoltaic cells while the brand mark itself represents the sun and the cycle of renewable energy.
