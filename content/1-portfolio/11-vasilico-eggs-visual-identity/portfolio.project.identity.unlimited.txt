Summary: 

Vasilico Eggs is a long-running family business with a history spanning more than three decades. The company was named after the birthplace of the founder, who started as a humble chicken farmer in 1967. Nearly three generations later, Vasilico Eggs is still dedicated to providing their customers with high-quality Cypriot chicken eggs.

We redesigned the visual identity of this quintessentially Cypriot brand, creating a complete system ranging from logos and colours to typography and patterns. The entire identity draws inspiration from Cypriot traditional art with a modern twist; the Vasilico Eggs brand mark follows design motives found in historical Cypriot mosaics, while the brand patterns reference traditional Cypriot textiles.
