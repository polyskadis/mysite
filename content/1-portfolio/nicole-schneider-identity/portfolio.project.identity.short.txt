Summary: Nicole Schneider is a freelance photographer specialising in product photography, social events, and photoreportage. As a regular collaborator with Design Temple, Nicoleâ€™s identity emerges from a close knowledge of her personality and work. A key trait of any good photographer is a good eye and knowing when to close the shutter. This concept inspired us to create an ownable logo mark for Nicole.
